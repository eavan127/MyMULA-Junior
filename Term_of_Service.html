                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Welcome to MyMULA Junior. These Terms of Service ("Terms",
                        "Terms of Service") govern your use of our mobile application (the "Service") operated by
                        MyMULA. Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect,
                        safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-[#111418] dark:text-white">2. Using Our Services</h3>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">You must follow any policies made available to you within the
                        Services. Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to
                        access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You
                        may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control
                        laws and regulations.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-[#111418] dark:text-white">3. Your MyMULA Junior Account</h3>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">You may need a MyMULA Junior Account in order to use some of
                        our Services. You may create your own MyMULA Junior Account, or your MyMULA Junior Account may
                        be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your guardian. If you are using a MyMULA Junior
                        Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your
                        administrator may be able to access or disable your account.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-[#111418] dark:text-white">4. Guardian Consent</h3>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">As a minor, your use of the MyMULA Junior application and its
                        services requires explicit consent from your legal guardian. Your guardian is responsible for
                        monitoring your use of the Service and ensuring compliance with these terms. By providing
                        consent, your guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service on your behalf.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-[#111418] dark:text-white">5. About these Terms</h3>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to
                        a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should
                        look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page.
                        Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days
                        after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made
                        for legal reasons will be effective immediately.</p>
